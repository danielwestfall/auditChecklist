          ><strong>2.2.1 Timing Adjustable:</strong> For each time limit that is
          set by the content, at least one of the following is true:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Turn off:</strong> The user can turn off the time limit
              before they encounter it; or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adjust:</strong> The user can adjust the time limit before
              they encounter it over a wide range that is at least ten times the
              length of the default setting; or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extend:</strong> The user can extend the time limit before
              it ends with a simple action (for example, "hit any key") without
              losing data after the time limit is extended by at least 20
              seconds; or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Real-time Exception:</strong> The time limit is a required
              part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no
              alternative to the time limit is possible; or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Essential Exception:</strong> The time limit is essential
              and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>20 Hour Exception:</strong> The time limit is longer than
              20 hours.

          This means that if the website has time limits (like session
          timeouts), you should be able to turn them off, adjust them, or get

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Does the time limit fit into any of
